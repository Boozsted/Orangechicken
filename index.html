    <p>Orange Chicken is one of my favorite Chinese recipes, so much that I decided to meal prep it for a healthier meal on-the-go.

        Itâ€™s just as easy, and it gets tastier with each day as the flavors penetrate into the chicken. Simply pair with some rice and vegetables to make a deliciously yummy meal.</p>

    <h3 class="h3class">ðŸ”¥How to Make ðŸ”¥</h3>

    <ul class="ulchicken">
<li><b>Step 1 â€“ Marinate the chicken:</b> Cut chicken breasts into 1â€³ cubes and coat with a mixture of orange zest, beaten egg, salt and pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.</li>
<li><b>Step 2 â€“ Frying:</b> Heat a medium saucepan or skillet to 350Â°F, using an oil thermometer to measure if youâ€™re not sure. Coat the chicken pieces in flour, shake off the excess, and then fry in two batches for 3-4 minutes each time.</li>
<li><b>Step 3 â€“ Make the Sauce:</b> In a separate saucepan, bring water, sugar and orange juice to a boil over medium heat. Mix the cornstarch with 3 tbsp of water in a cup and then to add the sauce whisking continuously to thicken slightly.</li>
<li><b>Step 4 â€“ Coat the Chicken:</b> Add the fried chicken pieces to the sauce, and stir or toss to coat evenly. Remove from heat.</li>

<p><b>Thatâ€™s it!!</b> You are ready to meal prep it! Let it cool slightly, and then add one third each of orange chicken, rice and vegetables to meal prep containers.</p>
